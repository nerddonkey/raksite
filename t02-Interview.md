## Leadership Experience

### Quick Synopsis of Leadership

- I lead by example.  It's easier to ask people to do something when it's clear you have done it yourself
- I mentor very well.

- **Department of Telecommunications Engineering:** A few years out of my PhD I helped secuee competitive strategic recurrent funds to start a new area at ANU in **Telecommunications Engineering**.  My PhD was in this area.  I'm an Electrical Engineer but I've gravitated towards the information processing "information" engineering which has a strong representation in the IEEE Professional field which dominates the quality journals and standards.  So my first leadership role was in a Department of Telecommunications Engineering, I was the head and there were 3-5 academics and roughly 10 PhD student (not all mine).  This department was one of three in a new Research School.  It was the smallest but punched well above its weight in all outputs.
- **NICTA Bid and Initial Phase:** Headed one of the firts round programs called **Wireless Signal Processing** and we had about 13 researchers at one point, and many PhD students.
- **Recalled to ANU to Lead The Depsrtment of Information Engineering:** was the merger of **Telecommunications Engineering** and the bigger **Systems Engineering**.  We are mostly a research department but volunteered into teach undergraduate courses.  We had a lot of PhD students, around 35.
- When the foundation Dean retired then I applied for Dean and was in the last two.  The overseas sourced Dean lasted about 18 months.  At that time I was **Director of Research**, and worked out of the exectutive office.
- A merged department had Research Groups and I led the one in **Applied Signal Processing**.
- There appears to be a lapse but I was offered the **CSIRO ICT Chief Scientist** position (replaying Trevor Bird).


### Experience with Running Departments

- dealing with people
- financial
   - planning out 3-5 years
   - operational dimensions
- recruitment
- enjoy and like working with financial and professional staff
   - I show them the highest respect
- highly regarded by everyone, and seen to be balanced and normal (10% of academics)
- can deal with a high dynamic range of actiities and can context switch between research and operational
- I have a strength in strategic thinking, areas that can be developed, formulate ideas
- I get helped
- I achieve a lot with the least energy
