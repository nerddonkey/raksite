        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, the problem of joint oscillator phase noise (PHN) estimation and data detection for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems using bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) is analyzed. A new MIMO receiver that iterates between the estimator and the detector, based on the expectation-maximization (EM) framework, is proposed. It is shown that at high signal-to-noise ratios, a maximum a posteriori estimator (MAP) can be used to carry out the maximization step of the EM algorithm. Moreover, to reduce the computational complexity of the proposed EM algorithm, a soft decision-directed extended Kalman filter-smoother (EKFS) is applied instead of the MAP estimator to track the PHN parameters. Numerical results show that by combining the proposed EKFS based approach with an iterative detector that employs low density parity check (LDPC) codes, PHN can be accurately tracked. Simulations also demonstrate that compared to existing algorithms, the proposed iterative receiver can significantly enhance the performance of MIMO systems in the presence of PHN.</div>

        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper investigates spectral filtering using isotropic spectral windows, which is a computationally efficient method of spatial smoothing on the sphere. We propose a Slepian eigenfunction window, which is obtained as a solution of the concentration problem on the sphere, as a good choice of the window function. We also unify a comprehensive set of quantitative tools, both spatial and spectral, to assess and compare the performance of different smoothing windows (i.e., smoothers). We analyze and compare the performance of the proposed window against the two best available candidates in the literature: von-Hann window and von Mises-Fisher distribution window. We establish that the latter window includes the popular Gauss window as a subcase. We show that the Slepian eigenfunction window has the smallest spatial variance (better spatial localization) and the smallest side-lobe level.</div>

        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Smallcell is emerging as a cost-effective solution for satisfying the huge demands of mobile data. It can be deployed at any place where mobile traffic is required without the need for cell planning. However, coexistence of many uncontrolled smallcells using the same licensed frequency band can result in serious interference problems. In order to utilize smallcell efficiently, it is highly desirable that the smallcell can self-organize the network and mitigate interference automatically. In this paper, we propose a dynamic fractional frequency reuse (FFR) method for reducing the intercell interference automatically and improving the spectral efficiency. Key features of the proposed method are sub-band optimization with a central manner and sub-band size adjustment with a distributed manner. The proposed method has a low complexity and can be implemented as a feature of a self-organizing network (SON) in smallcell. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</div>

        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper introduces an adaptive, multi-resolution windowing technique that can be used in conjunction with the spatially localized spherical harmonic transform (SLSHT) to process signals on the 2-sphere in the spatio-spectral domain. In contrast with the standard formulation, which uses a fixed window, the new windowing technique is able to respond locally to the signal under analysis, that is, be adaptive, and also is formulated to depend on the spectral degree to give it a multi-resolution character. We further enhance its simultaneous spatial and spectral localization by basing the window on a parametric band-limited Slepian maximum spatial concentration eigenfunction. The criterion for window design is to maximize the energy concentration in each spectral component in the spatio-spectral domain. A computationally efficient method is also developed to implement the adaptive window design. The superiority of the new adaptive, multi-resolution window technique is demonstrated with an example.</div>

        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper we consider the zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) criteria for signal recovery using linear operators as equalizers for signals observed on the 2-sphere that are subject to linear distortions and noise. The distortions considered are bounded operators and can include convolutions, rotations, spatial and spectral truncations, projections or combinations of these. Likewise the signal and noise are very general being modeled as anisotropic stochastic processes on the 2-sphere. In both the distortion model and signal model the findings in this paper are significantly more general than results that can be found in the literature. The MMSE equalizer is shown to reduce to the ZF equalizer when the distortion operator has an inverse and there is an absence of noise. The ability of the MMSE to recover a Mars topography map signal from a projection operator, which fails to have a ZF solution, is given as an illustration.</div>

        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cooperative communication systems employ coopera- tion among nodes in a wireless network to increase data throughput and robustness to signal fading. However, such advantages are only possible if there exist perfect synchronization among all nodes. Impairments like channel multipath, time varying phase noise (PHN) and carrier frequency offset (CFO) result in the loss of synchro- nization and diversity performance of cooperative communication systems. Joint estimation of these multiple impairments is necessary in order to correctly decode the received signal in cooperative systems. In this paper, we propose an iterative pilot-aided algorithm based on expectation conditional maximization (ECM) for joint estimation of multipath channels, Wiener PHNs, and CFOs in amplify-and-forward (AF) based cooperative orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. Numerical results show that the proposed estimator achieves mean square error performance close to the derived hybrid Cramer-Rao lower bound (HCRB) for different PHN variances.</div>

    <div id="KennedyCS2014-SPAWC-1569925685_abstract" style="display:none">
        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Two-way relaying networks (TWRNs) allow for more bandwidth efficient use of the available spectrum since they allow for simultaneous information exchange between two users with the assistance of an intermediate relay node. However, due to superposition of signals at the relay node, the received signal at the user terminals is affected by multiple impairments, i.e., channel gains, timing offsets, and carrier frequency offsets, that need to be jointly estimated and compensated. This paper presents a training-based system model for amplify-and-forward (AF) TWRNs in the presence of multiple impairments and proposes maximum likelihood and differential evolution based algorithms for joint estimation of these impairments. The Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for the joint estimation of multiple impairments are derived. A minimum mean-square error based receiver is then proposed to compensate the effect of multiple impairments and decode each user's signal. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed estimators is very close to the derived CRLBs at moderate-to-high signal-to-noise-ratios. It is also shown that the bit-error rate performance of the overall AF TWRN is close to a TWRN that is based on assumption of perfect knowledge of the synchronization parameters.</div>

        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we consider decode-and-forward (DF) relaying network based on wireless energy harvesting. The energy constrained relay node first harvests energy through radio-frequency (RF) signals from the source node. Next, the relay node uses the harvested energy to forward the decoded source information to the destination node. The source node transfers energy and information to the relay node through two mechanisms, i) time division multiplexing, i.e., time switching-based relaying (TSR) and ii) source power splitting, i.e., power splitting-based relaying (PSR). Considering wireless energy harvesting constraint at the relay node, we derive the exact analytical expressions of the achievable throughput and ergodic capacity of a DF relaying network for both TSR and PSR schemes. Through numerical analysis, we study the throughput performance of the overall system for different system parameters, such as energy harvesting time, power splitting ratio, source to relay distance, and noise power. In particular, the throughput performance of the PSR network outperforms the throughput performance of the TSR network at relatively high signal-to-noise-ratios.</div>
