        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this work, we design complete orthonormal basis functions, which are referred to as optimal basis functions, that span the vector sum of subspaces formed by band-limited spatially concentrated and space-limited spectrally concentrated functions. The optimal basis are shown to be a linear combination of band-limited functions with maximized energy concentration in some spatial region of interest and space-limited functions which maximize the energy concentra- tion in some spectral region. The linear combination is designed with an optimality condition of maximizing the product of measures of energy concentration in the spatial and spectral domain. We also show that each optimal basis is an eigenfunction of a linear operator which maximizes the product of energy concentration measures in spatial and spectral domain. Finally, we discuss the properties of the proposed optimal basis functions and highlight their usefulness for the signal representation and data analysis due to the simultaneous concentration of the proposed basis functions in spatial and spectral domains.</div>

        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> We develop a method to compute spherical harmonic transform (SHT) of a band-limited signal on the sphere discretized over a minimum dimensionality regular sampling grid on the sphere. For the compu- tation of SHT of a signal band-limited at L, the proposed method requires L2 number of samples on a regular grid composed of L iso-latitude rings of samples with only L samples in each ring along longitude. Since a signal band-limited at L is represented by L^2 degrees of freedom in the spectral (spherical harmonic) domain, the proposed method requires the minimal number of samples for the computation of SHT. In comparison to the other schemes that require 2L âˆ’ 1 samples along each iso-latitude ring, we show that the SHT can be computed, by exploiting the structure of spectral domain, from only L samples in each iso-latitude ring. We also analyse the numerical accuracy and the computational complexity of our proposed SHT for a regular grid with equiangular sampling. We demonstrate, through numerical experiments, that the proposed SHT is sufficiently accurate for band-limits of interest in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging.</div>

        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> We propose a sampling scheme on the sphere and develop a cor- responding spherical harmonic transform (SHT) for the accurate re- construction of the diffusion signal in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). By exploiting the antipodal symmetry, we design a sampling scheme that requires the optimal number of samples on the sphere, equal to the degrees of freedom required to represent the antipodally symmetric band-limited diffusion signal in the spec- tral (spherical harmonic) domain. Compared with existing sampling schemes on the sphere that allow for the accurate reconstruction of the diffusion signal, the proposed sampling scheme reduces the num- ber of samples required by a factor of two or more. We analyse the numerical accuracy of the proposed SHT and show through experi- ments that the proposed sampling allows for the accurate and rota- tionally invariant computation of the SHT to near machine precision accuracy.</div>
