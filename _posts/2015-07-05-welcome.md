## Course Description

This course presents the principles, theory and techniques fundamental to the analysis and design of continuous time and discrete time signal processing systems. The concepts are illustrated with examples from circuit theory, signal processing, bio-medical engineering, communications, etc. The course has three hardware laboratories using the **Telecommunications Instructional Modelling System (TIMS)** and one computer laboratory based around **MATLAB**.

The course title *"Signal Processing"* was chosen as an alternative to *"Signals and Systems"*, which is a better name (and the name of the text), so as to not clash with the general term *"Systems Engineering*" that means something different as used in a number of other courses such as ENGN2225 and ENGN2226.
