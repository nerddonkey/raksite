## Electronic and Communication Systems

### Discipline Description

Electronic engineering is the fundamental discipline underpinning the design of modern technologies such as mobile phones and broadband wireless systems that are essential to everyday life and our future well-being. Electronic engineers not only design and build the electronic systems but also the communications and signal processing technologies and algorithms that are at the heart of our modern world. This major has a particular emphasis on providing training and diversity of experiences in both hardware and theoretical aspects of modern electronic and communication systems. In particular, graduates are exposed to hands on practical work and critical thinking in the discipline to equip them with the knowledge and skills to enable them to be adaptable across rapidly changing industries and environments. The minor allows students to take a subset of the major courses to further their knowledge in electronics and communications.


### Discipline Committee Membership

1. [Dr. Salman Durrani][Salman] (Chair)
2. [Prof. Rodney Kennedy][Rod]
3. [A/Prof. Parastoo Sadeghi][Parastoo]
4. [Prof. Thushara Abhayapala][Thushara]


### Learning Outcomes

After completing the [Electronic and Communication Systems Major](http://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/major/ELCO-MAJ), students should be able to:

- apply the advanced engineering concepts, modelling techniques and mathematical tools to analyse and design electronic and communication systems
- conduct appropriate computer-based simulations and hardware experiments to investigate the performance of electronic and communication systems
- solve complex design problems in electronics and communication systems and critically evaluate the outcomes
- apply advanced knowledge of electronic engineering in diverse contexts and applications
- use systems engineering approaches in conducting electronic engineering projects
