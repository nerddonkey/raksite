## *ï¿¼Harnessing Spherical Geometry in Scientific and Engineering Data Processing*
{:.no_toc}

{% include toc.md %}

## Project Summary and Impact Statement

**Project Summary:** Spherical information underpins many natural phenomena, ranging from the distribution of galaxies in the Universe to the connectivity and neuronal activation in the human brain. Current major investments in scientific and medical instrumentation do not efficiently collect and process the massive amounts of data because they do not properly utilize its inherent spherical geometry.  Through harnessing spherical geometry, this project will address the above shortcomings and will provide advances across all these application domains. By collecting and processing data more efficiently, with greater fidelity, and by revealing features currently hidden, the methods developed will see the full benefit from the instrumentation capturing this data.

**Impact Statement:** Through proper collection and processing of data with spherical geometry, we can reliably learn: how the Universe is evolving; or gauge the impact of melting polar ice sheets on sea-level rise; or assess whether a person is susceptible to Alzheimer's disease. These pressing problems link with our needs to understand where we come from; or how we can protect the environment; or how to improve the quality of life.

==== Feb 2015
- finalized all the necessary ANU and ARC paperwork to release the funds
- prepared a revised budget
- informed the PI on the amount of the awarded ICA and initiated planning
- confirmed tentative dates for the two ICA activities in 2015
-- Kennedy to visit UCL (London) in July for at least 2 weeks
-- McEwen to visit ANU (Canberra) in September for a similar period
- identified one candidate for an ARC funded PhD scholarship. #This student had passed our competitive international admission process in late 2014 and had gained admission to ANU but at the time without fee or living allowance scholarships. With external scholarship funding the College will award a fee waiver. It is anticipated that the student can come to ANU to formally start in July. Prior to that date the student plans to start working on the grant in the form of reading and project discussions.
- identified the likely RA, Dr Zubair Khalid, who was named in the grant
