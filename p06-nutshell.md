Here are some various views on what this course is about and why it is useful/essential:

## Nutshell 1 (music interpretation)

- Composers write sheet music (and guitar tabs) because it is a natural way to represent and work with music.  Engineers use **Fourier analysis** in the same way.  In fact it is not a rough analogy, music notation *really* is a shorthand (short-time) *"Fourier Transform"*.
- In the same way anything we measure such as a signal (e.g., voltage waveform) is best thought of in musical terms and transformed to musical notes.
- Transforming a signal to musical notation is applying the *"Fourier Transform"* and the process is called *ANALYSIS*.
	- Analysis means taking an object-of-interest and breaking it up into its parts to understand how it works.
- Playing back music from musical notation is applying the *"Inverse Fourier Transform"* and called *SYNTHESIS*. 
	- Synthesis means combining parts to reconstruct an object-of-interest.
- A pianist sitting at a piano and playing from sheet music in front of him is performing an *"Inverse Fourier Transform"*, she is *synthesizing* the music.  The composer who hears music in her head and writes the musical notation is performing *analysis* &mdash; call this Fourier analysis.
- Synthesis recombines the parts to recreate the object-of-interest.
- Filtering means 
	- taking something, which contains the object-of-interest, and breaking it up into its parts
	- throwing away those parts we don't want or which are contaminated to much
	- recombining the *remaining* parts to recreate the object-of-interest
- Filtering Examples
	- take the recording of an orchestra playing music and by doing *"signal processing"* extract just the violins playing (not easy)
	- cleaning up medical images: [Computers_in_Nuclear_Medicine 2D Medical Image Processing][NucMed]

## Nutshell 2 (after you complete the course)

- It's a standard course on signals and systems, Fourier Transforms, frequency responses, convolutions, filters and sampling.
