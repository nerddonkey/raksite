## Project Summary and Impact Statement


**Project Summary:** Spherical information underpins many natural phenomena, ranging from the distribution of galaxies in the Universe to the connectivity and neuronal activation in the human brain. Current major investments in scientific and medical instrumentation do not efficiently collect and process the massive amounts of data because they do not properly utilize its inherent spherical geometry.  
Through harnessing spherical geometry, this project will address the above shortcomings and will provide advances across all these application domains. By collecting and processing data more efficiently, with greater fidelity, and by revealing features currently hidden, the methods developed will see the full benefit from the instrumentation capturing this data.

**Impact Statement:** Through proper collection and processing of data with spherical geometry, we can reliably learn: how the Universe is evolving; or gauge the impact of melting polar ice sheets on sea-level rise; or assess whether a person is susceptible to Alzheimer's disease. These pressing problems link with our needs to understand where we come from; or how we can protect the environment; or how to improve the quality of life.
