*by Oppenheim and Willsky (with Nawab)*

>
- it is recommended that either buy or get access to this text book
- students are expected to read relevant sections of the book during the semester, there are a number of problems one should attempt in addition to [*Homework Problems*][homework] and [*Assignments*][assignments]
- the lectures follow the material and notation in the book (but in a slightly different order and not the whole book)
- the [*Lecture Notes*][lectures], include on many slides the corresponding sections and pages in the book
- the [*Lecture Notes*][lect] are self-contained so you can get by without the book assuming:
	- you attend lectures or follow all lecture recordings available on Wattle
	- you are better than average student
