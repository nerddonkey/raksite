- For assignments you can work in small groups to discuss the problems but your final submission needs to be in your words and calculations.  Direct copying is not permitted and will be penalized.  Copying is particularly obvious when dunderhead students copy wrong answers.


## Labs 12%

**LAB** | **DESCRIPTION** | **MARKS**
:--: | :-- | :--:
[HLAB1][hlab1-p] | TIMS &mdash; *"Impulse and Step Responses of Systems"* | 3%
[HLAB2][hlab2-p] | TIMS &mdash; *"Fourier Series and Properties"* | 3%
[CLAB1][clab1-p] | MATLAB&reg; &mdash; *"Fourier Series Analysis of Square Wave"* | 3%
[HLAB3][hlab3-p] | TIMS &mdash; *"Frequency Response of Discrete Time Systems"* | 3%
 | | **12%**
 
- All 4 laboratories need to be completed in the allotted time and no lab report is necessary.  They are marked based on successful completion (50%) and the lab tutors assessment of your understanding (50%).  Unless your understanding is clearly deficient, under questioning, then you can expect to get full marks.
- Reading the handout before the laboratory is highly recommended.

## Final Mark for Course

- As with all courses the final grade is subject to *"moderation"*, which is a process that adjusts the
raw mark to compensate for assessment items that are found to be too hard or too easy relative to the 
long term standards of the course.
- Generally moderation assists students to pass in cases of an unintentionally hard exam, for example.
- Moderation never results in a raw mark Pass being converted to a Fail.
- The default intention is not to use moderation.
