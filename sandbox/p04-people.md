#### Remarks

- You must make reasonable efforts before seeking help on problems, such as those in assignments or homework, from any instructor.  You are expected to attend all lectures (or view all lecture recordings), review the lecture notes, read the corresponding parts of the text, and attend all tutorials.  For help with problems you may be requested to first show any working or attempts.
- Individual technical questions (and answers) extracted from instructors need to be shared with the whole class.  Questions can be asked through the forum in Wattle, before or after lectures, during tutorials.
- The instructors are not your personal tutors, you cannot expect them to individually guide you through solutions to problems and you cannot repeatedly harass them.  If you get personal help from any instructor you need to write up the question and solution and post it to the class forum.  Failure to do so within 1 week will result in 2 marks being deducted per question asked.
