        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper considers a transmission control problem in network-coded two-way relay channels (NC- TWRC), where the relay buffers random symbol arrivals from two users, and the channels are assumed to be fading. The problem is modeled by a discounted infinite horizon Markov decision process (MDP). The objective is to find a transmission control policy that minimizes the symbol delay, buffer overflow and transmission power consumption and error rate simultaneously and in the long run. By using the concepts of submodularity, multimodularity and L-convexity, we study the structure of the optimal policy searched by dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. We show that the optimal transmission policy is nondecreasing in queue occupancies or/and channel states under certain conditions such as the chosen values of parameters in the MDP model, channel modeling method, modulation scheme and the preservation of stochastic dominance in the transitions of system states. The results derived in this paper can be used to relieve the high complexity of DP and facilitate real-time control.</div>

        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper proposes the use of discrete stochastic approximation (DSA) algorithm for a cross- layer adaptive modulation problem in wireless communications. In this system, the throughput in the physical (PHY) layer and quality of service (QoS) incurred by the queueing effects in the data link layer are required to be optimized simultaneously and in the long run. By assuming Markov decision process (MDP) modeling, we prove that the optimal transmission policy is characterized by a queue threshold vector and can be determined by a multivariate discrete convex optimization problem if the dynamic programming (DP) is submodular. We then propose to use DSA, a subgradient-based stochastic approximation (SA) algorithm with proven convergence rate, for approximating the optimal value of the queue threshold vector. By an application in a cross-layer transmission control problem in a network-coded two way relay channel (NC-TWRC), we compare the performance of DSA with that of simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA), the commonly used SA algorithm for threshold policy optimization problems. The results show that DSA converges faster than SPSA resulting in lower and controllable computational cost.</div>

        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cooperative communication systems employ coopera- tion among nodes in a wireless network to increase data throughput and robustness to signal fading. However, such advantages are only possible if there exist perfect synchronization among all nodes. Impairments like channel multipath, time varying phase noise (PHN) and carrier frequency offset (CFO) result in the loss of synchro- nization and diversity performance of cooperative communication systems. Joint estimation of these multiple impairments is necessary in order to correctly decode the received signal in cooperative systems. In this paper, we propose an iterative pilot-aided algorithm based on expectation conditional maximization (ECM) for joint estimation of multipath channels, Wiener PHNs, and CFOs in amplify-and-forward (AF) based cooperative orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. Numerical results show that the proposed estimator achieves mean square error performance close to the derived hybrid Cramer-Rao lower bound (HCRB) for different PHN variances.</div>

        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> We formulate and solve the Slepian spatial-spectral concentration problem on the three-dimensional ball. Both the standard Fourier-Bessel and also the Fourier-Laguerre spectral domains are considered since the latter exhibits a number of practical advantages (spectral decoupling and exact computation). The Slepian spatial and spectral concentration problems are formulated as eigenvalue problems, the eigenfunctions of which form an orthogonal family of concentrated functions. Equivalence between the spatial and spectral problems is shown. The spherical Shannon number on the ball is derived, which acts as the analog of the space-bandwidth product in the Euclidean setting, giving an estimate of the number of concentrated eigenfunctions and thus the dimension of the space of functions that can be concentrated in both the spatial and spectral domains simultaneously. Various symmetries of the spatial region are considered that reduce considerably the computational burden of recovering eigenfunctions, either by decoupling the problem into smaller subproblems or by affording analytic calculations. The family of concentrated eigenfunctions forms a Slepian basis that can be used be represent concentrated signals efficiently. We illustrate our results with numerical examples and show that the Slepian basis indeeds permits a sparse representation of concentrated signals.</div>

        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> We develop a sampling scheme on the sphere that permits accurate computation of the spherical harmonic transform and its inverse for signals band-limited at L using only L2 samples. We obtain the optimal number of samples given by the degrees of freedom of the signal in harmonic space. The number of samples required in our scheme is a factor of two or four fewer than existing techniques, which require either 2L^2 or 4L^2 samples. We note, however, that we do not recover a sampling theorem on the sphere, where spherical harmonic transforms are theoretically exact. Nevertheless, we achieve high accuracy even for very large band-limits. For our optimal-dimensionality sampling scheme, we develop a fast and accurate algorithm to compute the spherical harmonic transform (and inverse), with computational complexity comparable with existing schemes in practice. We conduct numerical experiments to study in detail the stability, accuracy and computational complexity of the proposed transforms. We also highlight the advantages of the proposed sampling scheme and associated transforms in the context of potential applications.</div>

        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper considers amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying networks where an energy constrained relay node first harvests energy through the received radio-frequency signal from the source and then uses the harvested energy to forward the source information to the destination node. We propose adaptive time- switching protocols for wireless energy harvesting (EH) and information transmission by adapting the time-duration of EH at the relay node based on the available harvested energy and the source-to-relay channel quality. Specifically, we consider both continuous and discrete time-switching protocols and account for energy accumulation at the relay. For continuous time-switching protocols, the EH time can be set to any percentage of the total transmission block time. For discrete time-switching protocols, the whole transmission block is either used for EH or information transmission. We derive analytical expressions of the achievable throughput for both the continuous and the discrete time-switching protocols. The derived expressions provide practical insights into the effect of various parameters, such as relay transmission power and noise power, on the system performance. Finally, we compare the performance of the proposed continuous and discrete time-switching protocols through rigorous numerical analysis.</div>

Through analysis and performance studies we show that the performance of CMA is adversely affected by the intrinsic spatial correlation of natural images and by any deviation of their distribution from platykurtosis.

        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> We introduce a method for securely delivering a set of messages to a group of clients over a broadcast erasure channel where each client is interested in a distinct message. Each client is able to obtain its own message but not the others'. In the proposed method the messages are combined together using a special variant of random linear network coding. Each client is provided with a private set of decoding coefficients to decode its own message. Our method provides security for the transmission sessions against computational brute-force attacks and also weakly security in information theoretic sense. As the broadcast channel is assumed to be erroneous, the missing coded packets should be recovered in some way. We consider two different scenarios. In the first scenario the missing packets are retransmitted by the base station (centralized). In the second scenario the clients cooperate with each other by exchanging packets (decentralized). In both scenarios, network coding techniques are exploited to increase the total throughput. For the case of centralized retransmissions we provide an analytical approximation for the throughput performance of instantly decodable network coded (IDNC) retransmissions as well as numerical experiments. For the decentralized scenario, we propose a new IDNC based retransmission method where its performance is evaluated via simulations and analytical approximation. Application of this method is not limited to our special problem and can be generalized to a new class of problems introduced in this paper as the cooperative index coding problem.</div>

        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper deals with two significant questions associated with HRTF measurement: (i) what is the required angular resolution, and (ii) what is the most suitable sampling scheme. The paper shows that a well-defined finite number of spherical harmonics can capture the HRTF spatial variations in sufficient detail, which is defined as the HRTF spatial dimensionality. For the 20 kHz audible frequency range, the value of the dimensionality means a high directional resolution HRTF measurement is required. Considering such a high resolution measurement, a number of sampling criteria have been identified from both mechanical setup and data processing aspects. Different sampling candidates are then compared to demonstrate that the best method which satisfies all requirements is the class termed as IGLOO. A fast spherical harmonic transform algorithm based on the IGLOO scheme is developed to accelerate the high resolution data analysis. The proposed method is validated through simulation and experimental data acquired from a KEMAR mannequin.</div>
