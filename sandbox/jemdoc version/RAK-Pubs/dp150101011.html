        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> We formulate and solve the Slepian spatial-spectral concentration problem on the three-dimensional ball. Both the standard Fourier-Bessel and also the Fourier-Laguerre spectral domains are considered since the latter exhibits a number of practical advantages (spectral decoupling and exact computation). The Slepian spatial and spectral concentration problems are formulated as eigenvalue problems, the eigenfunctions of which form an orthogonal family of concentrated functions. Equivalence between the spatial and spectral problems is shown. The spherical Shannon number on the ball is derived, which acts as the analog of the space-bandwidth product in the Euclidean setting, giving an estimate of the number of concentrated eigenfunctions and thus the dimension of the space of functions that can be concentrated in both the spatial and spectral domains simultaneously. Various symmetries of the spatial region are considered that reduce considerably the computational burden of recovering eigenfunctions, either by decoupling the problem into smaller subproblems or by affording analytic calculations. The family of concentrated eigenfunctions forms a Slepian basis that can be used be represent concentrated signals efficiently. We illustrate our results with numerical examples and show that the Slepian basis indeeds permits a sparse representation of concentrated signals.</div>

    <div id="Bates:2015_abstract" style="display:none">
        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents a novel sampling scheme on the sphere for obtaining head-related transfer function (HRTF) measurements and accurately computing the spherical harmonic transform~(SHT). The scheme requires an optimal number of samples, given by the degrees of freedom in the spectral domain, for the accurate representation of the HRTF that is band-limited in the spherical harmonic domain. The proposed scheme allows for the samples to be easily taken over the sphere due to its iso-latitude structure and non-dense sampling near the poles. In addition, the scheme can be used when samples are not taken from the south polar cap region of the sphere as the HRTF measurements are not reliable in south polar cap region due to reflections from the ground. Furthermore, the scheme has a hierarchical structure, which enables the HRTF to be analysed at different audible frequencies using the same sampling configuration. In comparison to the proposed scheme, none of the other sampling schemes on the sphere simultaneously possess all these properties. We conduct several numerical experiments to determine the accuracy of the SHT associated with the proposed sampling scheme. We show that the SHT attains accuracy on the order of numerical precision $(10^-14)$ when samples are taken over the whole sphere, both in the optimal sample placement and hierarchical configurations, and achieves an acceptable level of accuracy $(10^-5)$ when samples are not taken over the south polar cap region of the sphere for the band-limits of interest. Simulations are used to show the accurate reconstruction of the HRTF over the whole sphere, including unmeasured locations.</div>

        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper considers the 3D spatial fading correla- tion (SFC) resulting from an angle-of-arrival (AoA) distribution that can be modelled by a mixture of Fisher-Bingham distribu- tions on the sphere. By deriving a closed-form expression for the spherical harmonic transform for the component Fisher-Bingham distributions, with arbitrary parameter values, we obtain a closed-form expression of the 3D-SFC for the mixture case. The 3D-SFC expression is general and can be used in arbitrary multi- antenna array geometries and is demonstrated for the cases of a 2D uniform circular array in the horizontal plane and a 3D regular dodecahedral array. In computational aspects, we use recursions to compute the spherical harmonic coefficients and give pragmatic guidelines on the truncation size in the series representations to yield machine precision accuracy results. The results are further corroborated through numerical experiments to demonstrate that the closed-form expressions yield the same results as significantly more computationally expensive numerical integration methods.</div>

        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this work, we design complete orthonormal basis functions, which are referred to as optimal basis functions, that span the vector sum of subspaces formed by band-limited spatially concentrated and space-limited spectrally concentrated functions. The optimal basis are shown to be a linear combination of band-limited functions with maximized energy concentration in some spatial region of interest and space-limited functions which maximize the energy concentra- tion in some spectral region. The linear combination is designed with an optimality condition of maximizing the product of measures of energy concentration in the spatial and spectral domain. We also show that each optimal basis is an eigenfunction of a linear operator which maximizes the product of energy concentration measures in spatial and spectral domain. Finally, we discuss the properties of the proposed optimal basis functions and highlight their usefulness for the signal representation and data analysis due to the simultaneous concentration of the proposed basis functions in spatial and spectral domains.</div>

        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> We develop a method to compute spherical harmonic transform (SHT) of a band-limited signal on the sphere discretized over a minimum dimensionality regular sampling grid on the sphere. For the compu- tation of SHT of a signal band-limited at L, the proposed method requires L2 number of samples on a regular grid composed of L iso-latitude rings of samples with only L samples in each ring along longitude. Since a signal band-limited at L is represented by L^2 degrees of freedom in the spectral (spherical harmonic) domain, the proposed method requires the minimal number of samples for the computation of SHT. In comparison to the other schemes that require 2L − 1 samples along each iso-latitude ring, we show that the SHT can be computed, by exploiting the structure of spectral domain, from only L samples in each iso-latitude ring. We also analyse the numerical accuracy and the computational complexity of our proposed SHT for a regular grid with equiangular sampling. We demonstrate, through numerical experiments, that the proposed SHT is sufficiently accurate for band-limits of interest in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging.</div>

        <div class="Abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> We propose a sampling scheme on the sphere and develop a cor- responding spherical harmonic transform (SHT) for the accurate re- construction of the diffusion signal in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). By exploiting the antipodal symmetry, we design a sampling scheme that requires the optimal number of samples on the sphere, equal to the degrees of freedom required to represent the antipodally symmetric band-limited diffusion signal in the spec- tral (spherical harmonic) domain. Compared with existing sampling schemes on the sphere that allow for the accurate reconstruction of the diffusion signal, the proposed sampling scheme reduces the num- ber of samples required by a factor of two or more. We analyse the numerical accuracy of the proposed SHT and show through experi- ments that the proposed sampling allows for the accurate and rota- tionally invariant computation of the SHT to near machine precision accuracy.</div>
