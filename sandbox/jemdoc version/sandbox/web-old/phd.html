					<div class="ThesisTopic">Multi-modal volumetric image registration using mutual information and GPU accelerated hardware processing.&nbsp&nbsp<strong>[Medical Image Processing]</strong>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Registration is a problem frequently encountered in medical image analysis. It is often required to align images acquired by different imaging devices and techniques (accounting for multi-modalities) and at different times (including long periods resulting in multi-temporal images). Registration allows for comparison of complimentary features, natural or pathological differences, data fusion and compiling atlases and is used in diagnosis, treatment planning and image guided surgery to name a few applications.  For certain applications it is impractical or impossible to use fiducial markers or landmarks or simply the images may have been acquired without such planning. The group of automatic registration methods align images by maximizing a similarity measure using image information over a possible range of transformation parameters.</p>

<p>Since it is virtually impossible to try all combinations of transformation parameters, an optimization method such as Powell, simplex, gradient descent, etc., has to be used. There are two major limitations with automatic registration methods: (a) the robustness of the optimization is dependent on the shape of the cost function and can often lead to mis-registration due to presence of local minima, (b) the calculation of the cost function involves image transformation and calculation of the similarity measure which can be time consuming.</p>

<p>We are currently looking at the application of registration for endoscopic and laproscopic surgery. A probe, equipped with an electromagnetic tracker and a ultrasound (US) transducer is navigated through the patients body and produces real-time US images. To allow a more accurate treatment of the patient we aim to register the 2D US images against a high resolution 3D CT image which has been acquired prior to the operation.</p>

<p><strong>Research Outcomes:</strong> The research aims to find methods that overcome the above limitations and allow for accurate and efficient automatic registration of multi-modal images, including MR, PET, and CT scans. To this end, we propose to estimate transformation parameters and optimize a mutual information (MI)-based cost function using the estimated parameters as the starting point. The method is expected to improves the robustness of the registration task by avoiding local minima and improve efficiency by reducing the number of iterations required for convergence of the optimization algorithm.</p>

<p>Further work is aimed at real-time registration of 2D US images with pre-operative CT. The problem of registering a 2D US to a 3D volume is extremely ill-posed due to low resolution and image artifacts in US and small size of US data sample compared to the CT volume. To alleviate this problem, we propose to use a tracker to get an initial position of the ultrasound and limit the search space. We also propose to use multiple temporal frames of the ultrasound to further constrain the problem with the 3D space of the CT volume. </p>
